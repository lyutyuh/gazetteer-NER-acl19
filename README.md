## Installation

First of all:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lyutyuh/acl19_subtagger.git ; cd acl19_subtagger
```

1. Create a virtual environment with Conda
```bash
    conda create -n softdict --file requirements_conda.txt -c conda-forge/label/broken -c conda-forge
```

2. Activate the new environment
```bash
    conda activate softdict
```

3. Install the pip requirements
```bash
    pip install -r requirements_pip.txt
```

4. Prepare the configurations
```bash
    sed -i 's@INSTALLATION_DIR@'"$PWD"'@' configs/*.config
```

## Training

```bash
    allennlp train configs/HSCRF_softDictionary.conll2003.config -s dump_directory/ --include-package models 
```

## Evaluating

```bash
    allennlp evaluate dump_directory/model.tar.gz https://www.jeffliu.page/files/DATA/conll2003/test.txt --include-package models    
```
